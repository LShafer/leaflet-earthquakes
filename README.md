# leaflet-earthquakes - Visualizing Data with Leaflet

### Earthquake Map

1. **Data Collection**

   Earthquake data for this map is provided by the USGS GeoJSON feed, located here: [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)
   
   Data on tectonic plates can be found here: <https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates>

2. **Build the Map**

   Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.

   * Data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and darker in color.

   * Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
   
   * Add a number of base maps to choose from as well as create two overlays (one for earthquakes and one for fault lines) that can be turned on and off independently.

   * Add layer controls to the map.

   * Create a legend that will provide context for the map data.
